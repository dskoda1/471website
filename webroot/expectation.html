<div style="text-align: left; margin-left: 40px;">Programming
Languages
uses human readable form to describe computable process, CS471 strives
to provide an environment where skills are developed to empower
students to learn new ways to describe computable
processes.&nbsp;&nbsp;
CS471, Programming Languages, is a core computer science course as such
all CS majors need to demonstrate basic understand of how computer
languages are implemented, and how to code in alternative paradigms.<br>

<div style="text-align: left;">Provide an introduction to programming
languages as an
intellectual discipline; through topics such as at the end of this
course, a student should have a deep, working knowledge of the key
concepts, features and ideas used in modern programming languages. More
specifically: Read and understand the new languages quickly from their
descriptions, and also be able to describe and document languages. This
is a necessary skill to survive in computer science.
</div>
<h3><a name="Topics"></a>Topics to be
covered include:</h3>
</center>

<ol>

The topics covered through lectures and weekly programming and/or
written homework assignments:<br>

These topics will be covered both in class and in reading
assignments.&nbsp; By the end of the semester students should
understand
the different choices selected to be implemented in any particular
language and the (positive and negative) consequences of these choices.

<h3>Grading
Policy:</h3>
<div style="text-align: left;">Missing homework assignment may result in failure of this course.&nbsp;
Late homework will not be accepted after the due date except by prior
permission. See details on submitting&nbsp; homework.<br>
<br>
Written Homework: 7%<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Written assignments are to be typed and
turned in by the due date on
blackboard (tar or zip multipule files).&nbsp; You may research
solutions to
all homework problems (programming and written).&nbsp; ALL
HELP/HINTS/SOLUTIONS must credited, otherwise it is considered
cheating.&nbsp; Remember the goal is to learn.&nbsp; Remember you are
responsible
for the correctness of everything you write.&nbsp; Failure to credit
other
students or sources can result in a zero on the homework.&nbsp; <br>
Late homework will not be accepted after the due date except by
permission.&nbsp;&nbsp; You are responsible for the correctness of your
answers. You must attempt all homework assignments, failure to do so
may result in zero for all homework and/or zero for quizzes. You may
work in teams of 2, in which case you should turn on ONE copy of the
assignment with both names and course sections on it.&nbsp; <br>
Understandability of the
solutions is as necessary as correctness. Expect to lose points if you
provide a badly written &#8220;correct&#8221; solution.&nbsp; You are allowed to
consult
other books on homework, but you must cite your sources and write up
your answers in such a way as to demonstrate that you understand the
published solutions.</div>

<br>
Programming Assignments and Lab assignments: 13%:<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">All programs are an individual
effort.&nbsp; You are not to share code with other classmates until
assignments are .&nbsp; It is better to receive help with debugging
code from the instructor or ta/ca.&nbsp; You can not pass this course
if you don't learn to program simple algorithms using the different
languages paradigms presented in class. <br>
You may discuss homework problems, general strategies or algorithms
with other students in the course, but you may not collaborate in the
development of detail or actual writing of program, e.g. you may NOT
work from written notes developed collaboratively. Students may not
look at other students code for programs to be turned in. If you run
into a programming problem PLEASE keep a balance between receiving help
in debugging and doing your work.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is your own
responsibility to protect your work from unauthorized access. THE GOAL
is for YOU to LEARN how to program.<br>
</div>
&nbsp;<br>
Presentation and Presentation Attendance: 6%/4% (10%)<br>
There will be no make ups.&nbsp; You must be present at all labs.
Presentation and research should be done in a team of 2-4
students.&nbsp; Presentations should be between 20-30 minutes.&nbsp;
Written document 10-20 pages double space.&nbsp; Members of the team
should have limited experience with the topic.&nbsp; Any unexcused
absence from any presentation will result in a negative grade.<br>
<br>
Tests : 70% <br>
<br>
There will be 3 or 4 tests.&nbsp; There will be a test during finals
week.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Academic dishonesty has no place in a
university: It wastes our time and yours, and is unfair to the majority
of students. Any violation of this code will be penalized and can lead
to failure in the course. When in doubt, ask beforehand! <br>
