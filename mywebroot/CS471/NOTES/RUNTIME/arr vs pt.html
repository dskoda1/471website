7 A declaration of a parameter as &#8216;&#8216;array of type&#8217;&#8217; shall be adjusted
to &#8216;&#8216;qualified pointer to type&#8217;&#8217;, where the type qualifiers (if any)
are those specified within the [ and ] of the array type derivation. If
the keyword static also appears within the [ and ] of the array type
derivation, then for each call to the function, the value of the
corresponding actual argument shall provide access to the first element
of an array with at least as many elements as specified by the size
expression.<br>
