  <b>Written assignments are to be typed </b>and turned in

may research solutions to

you are
responsible for the correctness of everything you write.&nbsp;
Failure
to credit other students or sources can result in a zero on the
homework. &nbsp; <br>

Be clear, and neat in your write-ups. Understandability of the
solutions is as necessary as correctness. Expect to lose points if you
provide a badly written &#8220;correct&#8221;
solution.&nbsp; You are
allowed to
consult other books on homework, but you must cite your sources and
write up your answers in such a way as to demonstrate that you
understand the published solutions.

homework problems, general strategies or algorithms with other students
in the course, but you may not collaborate in the development of detail
or actual writing of program, e.g. you may NOT work from written notes
developed collaboratively. Students may not look at other students code
for programs to be turned in. If you run into a programming problem
PLEASE keep a balance between receiving help in debugging and doing
your
work.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is your own responsibility to protect your

  <p>You should contact me (by email) or the ca if you have

program
in it.&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>You must cite any found solutions</b>.
I don't want you to spend many
hours debugging. You may have anyone look over your code to help you
find simple
syntax error. If the problem is deeper you should contact&nbsp; the
TA or me for help. Copying code&nbsp;IS a violation
