Languages
uses human readable form to describe computable process, CS471 strives
to provide an environment where skills are developed to empower
students to learn new ways to describe computable
processes.&nbsp;&nbsp;
CS471, Programming Languages, is a core computer science course as such
all CS majors need to demonstrate basic understand of how computer
languages are implemented, and how to code in alternative paradigms.<br>

These topics will be covered by readings, lectures and
assignments.&nbsp; By the end of the semester students should
understand
the different choices selected to be implemented in any particular
language and the (positive and negative) consequences of these
choices.&nbsp; Read and understand new languages quickly from their
descriptions.&nbsp; This is a necessary skill to survive in computer
science. <br>

<div style="text-align: left;">Missing homework assignment may result in failure of this course.&nbsp;
Late homework will not be accepted after the due late date except by prior
permission (by TA). See <a href="/#/CS471/requirements.html">details</a> on submitting&nbsp; homework.&nbsp; Note students are expected to put in&nbsp; <span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">12.5 hours a week for a 4 credit course</span>.&nbsp; This includes 4.5 hours of class and lab time and 8 hours for reading and homework assignments.<br>

<br>If you can not complete an homework assignment or lab assignment --
TURN IN WHAT YOU HAVE DONE.
TURNING IN NOTHING FOR AN ASSIGNMENT WILL RESULT IN A NEGATIVE
GRADE.&nbsp;&nbsp; YOU SHOULD TURN in ALL ASSIGNMENTS EVEN IF IT IS
PAST THE DUE DATE otherwise you may not be <span class="spell"><b>illegible to take the exams.<br>
<br>
</b></span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">
Written Homework:</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">6%</span><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Written assignments are to be typed and
turned in by the due date on
blackboard (tar or zip multipule files).&nbsp; You may research
solutions to
all homework problems (programming and written).&nbsp; ALL
HELP/HINTS/SOLUTIONS must credited, otherwise it is considered
cheating.&nbsp; Remember the goal is to learn.&nbsp; Remember you are
responsible
for the correctness of everything you write.&nbsp; Failure to credit
other
students or sources can result in a zero on the homework.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Late homework will not be accepted after the due date except by
permission.&nbsp;&nbsp; You are responsible for the correctness of your
answers. You must attempt all homework assignments, failure to do so
may result in zero for all homework and/or zero for quizzes. On some (noted) assignments you may
work in teams of 2, in which case you should turn on ONE copy of the
assignment with both names and include both names in a comment when you upload your assignment to blackboard.<br>
Understandability of the
solutions is as necessary as correctness. Expect to lose points if you
provide a badly written &#8220;correct&#8221; solution.&nbsp; You are allowed to
consult
other books on homework, but you must cite your sources and write up
your answers in such a way as to demonstrate that you understand the
published solutions.<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>

<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">All programs are an individual
effort.&nbsp; YOU MAY share code with other classmates ONLY AFTER
assignments are turned in .&nbsp; It is better to receive help with
debugging
code from the instructor or ta/ca.&nbsp; You can not pass this course
if you don't learn to program simple algorithms using the different
languages paradigms presented in class. <br>
You may discuss homework problems, general strategies or algorithms
with other students in the course, but you may not collaborate in the
development of detail or actual writing of program, e.g. you may NOT
work from written notes developed collaboratively. Students may not
look at other students code for programs to be turned in. If you run
into a programming problem PLEASE keep a balance between receiving help
in debugging and doing your work.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is your own
responsibility to protect your work from unauthorized access. THE GOAL
is for YOU to LEARN how to program.<big><br>

Presentations should be between 20-40 minutes.&nbsp; Each team will
submit a 1-2 page abstraction of&nbsp; presentation, references to all
material used, and any presentation material. &nbsp;&nbsp; Each team
members
should have limited experience with the topic.&nbsp; Attendence at all
presentations is required. Any unexcused
absence from any presentation can result in a negative grade.&nbsp;
