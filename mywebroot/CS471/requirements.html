<h2>CS471 Homework Instructions</h2>
</center>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">The purpose of the written assignments
are to help you understand and apply programming language concepts to
practical (common) languages.&nbsp; Therefore to pass this course you
must have an average of 65% on the written assignments.&nbsp; You are
expected to turn in homework every week even if you can not complete
every question.&nbsp; You should document any problems with your code
not meeting specifications.</span><br>
  
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>

</span>

<h3><b><b>This semester all homework assignments will turned into the digital box in BLACKBOARD:<br>

<ol>
  <li style="font-weight: bold;">All code will be plain text
file.&nbsp; All written assignments will be either plain text or pdf
files.&nbsp; If you submit any other format you will be asked to
resubmit. Make sure your name and bmail appear at the top of the file.<br></li>

  <ul>
    <li style="font-weight: bold;">Written
assignments will be done in ONE file. If there are specific questions
related to coding code should be submitted in a separate file in the
tar. It is expected that all code can be compiled and run.</li>
    

    <li style="font-weight: bold;">Prolog
and Haskell assignments should be in ONE .pl or .lhs file. If there are
written questions for the assignments, they will be answered in
COMMENTS included in the file. </li><li style="font-weight: bold;">You must submit the
assignment as a tarball. DO NOT create a tarball that includes the
directory, simply create a tar of all the files INSIDE the directory
where you have been working on your assignment. The exact command to
create an acceptable tarball is below. </li>
