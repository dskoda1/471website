/* Rename this file to include your username and add the extension ".pl" */
/* Purpose:
 * to practice writing relations in Prolog
 
   This assignment is not intended to be hard, however many students will need
   time to absorb how easy it really is. So don't get discouraged. 
   Most require only two clauses and none require more than 3 clauses.
   You should add the extension ".pl" to the file name.

    Define a predicate convertToDecimal(Succ, Decimal), which converts the
    succ representation for numbers to decimal representation.
i.e.
  ?- convertToDecimal(succ(succ(succ(succ(succ(0))))),N).
  N = 5.
  ?- convertToDecimal(S,4).
  S = succ(succ(succ(succ(0)))) .

numeral(0).
numeral(succ(X)) :- numeral(X).


/*2: Define a predicate grtThanLst(Lst1, Lst2), such that it succeeds if each  
     corresponding element in Lst1 has a greater the corresponding element in Lst2.  
     Comment any assumptions you make. 
     Depending on your assumptions this can be done with
     2 clauses, or 3 clauses or 4 clauses.
     
     
     ?- grtThanLst([1,15,2],[0,11,1]).
     true.
     ?- grtThanLst([1,15,2],[0,51,1]).
     false.

/* 3: Define a predicate hasSubseq(L,S), such that it succeeds if the list L 
      contains the list S as a sub-sequence of equivalent items. 
      Use a recursive definition.
      e.g. 
      ?-hasSubseq([a,g,b,d],[g,b]). 
      true .
      ?- hasSubseq([a,g,b,d],[g,d]). 
      true .
      ?- hasSubseq([a,g,b,d],[b,g]).
      false.
      
      (This can be done with 3 clauses.)
      
   */



/*4: Define a predicate init(Lst, InitOfLst) succeeds if InitOfLst is the same 
     as Lst except the last element of Lst is missing. i.e. 
     ?- init([a,b,c,d,e],Init). 
     Init= [a, b, c, d] 
     true
     
     (This can be done with 2 clauses.)
 */



/*5: Define the procedure 'zip' so that zip(Lst1,Lst2,Zipped) succeeds if
     Zipped is a list of sequences (tuples) . The first value of the sequence 
     is from the corresponding position from Lst1 and the second value is from 
     corresponding position from Lst2. Note: The length of Zipped will be the
     minimum of the length of Lst1 and length of Lst2. e.g.
           ?- zip([1,2,3,4],[a,b,c],Z).
           Z = [ (1, a), (2, b), (3, c)] .

           ?- zip([a],[1,2,3,4],Z).
           Z = [ (a, 1)] .

           ?- zip([a],[],[(a,a)]).
           false.
           
      (This can be done with 3 clauses.)
