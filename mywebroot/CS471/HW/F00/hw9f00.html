Assignment 9: Due Friday Oct. 28</h4>
Read Chapters:
<blockquote>Scott: Chapter 7.4-7.8
<br>&nbsp;<a href="http://bingweb.binghamton.edu/~head/CS471/NOTES/RUNTIME/PointerRef.html">Additional
notes from other sources on Pointers and reference types in C and C++</a></blockquote>

<h4>
Written assignment</h4>

<ol>
<li>
Java, unlike C++ , does not provide destructors.&nbsp; What does the language
do when an object should be destroyed? When does this happen in Java?</li>

<ol>&nbsp;</ol>

<li>
An index check verifies that the index of an array is in the bounds declared
for the array. Can an index check be performed statically? Why? Why not?</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
What is the solution adopted by C, Java, <a href="http://www.adahome.com/LRM/83/RM/rm83html/lrm-03-02.html#3.2">Ada83</a>
(for Ada only, just discuss objects) and C++ to the problem of uninitialized
variables?</li>

<ol>&nbsp;</ol>

<li>
In C++, what is the difference between assigning a value to a pointer and
to a reference?</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
In C++, what is the difference between taking the address (via operation
&amp;) of a pointer and of a reference? (You can just write a little test
program in C++)</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
What is the difference between a reference type variables in C++ and reference
type variables in Java? How do you simulate the reference type semantics
of C++ in Java?</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Given the following declaration in Ada :</li>

<br>TYPE Array_type IS ARRAY(10..14) OF Integer;
<br>TYPE CODE is record
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Status : CHARACTER;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Salary : Integer;
<br>end record;
<br>TYPE Code_Array IS ARRAY(0..5) OF CODE;
<br>arr : Array_type;
<br>codeArr : Code_Array;
<p>If INTEGER requires 4 bytes of storage and CHARACTER requires 1 byte
of storage what is the effective address (using bytes as the addressable
<br>units) of (show your calculations) You should assume that the ba (base
address) for arr is 250 and the base address for codeArr is 2000.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; A.arr(11)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; B.codeArr(1)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; C.codeArr(1).Salary</ol>

<h5>
Do not turn in. Things to think about and play with.</h5>

<ol>
<li>
What does iter do? ( id, foldr and replicate are in Prelude)</li>

<br><tt>iter n f = foldr (.) id (replicate n f)</tt>
<li>
(10.5) What is the type(:t)&nbsp; and effect of the function</li>

<br><tt>\n -> iter n succ</tt>
<br><tt>?</tt>
<li>
What happens when you try to type</li>

<br><tt>iter n succ</tt>
<br><tt>?</tt></ol>
