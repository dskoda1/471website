<b>Programming Assignment:</b></h3>
<b>Do not post your assignment.&nbsp; Email your code to&nbsp;</b> <a href="mailto:cs471h@binghamton.edu">cs471h</a>
also following <a href="http://bingweb.binghamton.edu/~head/CS471/requirements.html">instructions</a>
for how to document your program and name your <b>attached program file.&nbsp;
The due date may be extended but start on the coding.</b>
<ul>
<ol>
<li>
The BookCompany program creates an inventory by adding "Book"s to the inventory.&nbsp;
The program can add "Book"s to the inventory, sort the inventory and print
out the inventory.&nbsp; It is implemented in three paradigms using Haskell,
Java and C. All three implementations use the generic sort method supplied
in their respective library.&nbsp; The sorting order of the "Book"s is
based on the ascending order of year, followed by the ascending lexical
order of the book title..</li>

<ol TYPE=A>
<ol TYPE=a>
<li>
The Haskell version, <a href="http://bingweb.binghamton.edu/~head/CS471/CODE/Scripts/BookCompany.lhs">BookCompany.lhs&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;
is implemented literal style. It uses the sort definition found in <a href="http://haskell.org/onlinelibrary/list.html">List.hs</a>
. In order to use the sort the type Book must be in the class Ord.&nbsp;
Therefore the user must declare Book to be in class Ord as well as implement
the expected methods.</li>

<li>
The Java implementation, <a href="http://bingweb.binghamton.edu/~head/CS471/CODE/Scripts/BookCompany.java">BookCompany.java,</a>
uses the static method&nbsp; <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.2/docs/api/java/util/Collections.html#sort(java.util.List, java.util.Comparator)">sort</a>
found in the <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.2/docs/api/java/util/Collections.html">java.util.Collections</a>
class .&nbsp; Sort uses a modified mergesort to sort a list of mutually
comparable elements.&nbsp; The user must supply an ordering of "Book" to
the sorting method.&nbsp; This is done by implementing the interface <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.2/docs/api/java/util/Comparator.html">Comparator</a>
for the elements type in the list and passing the an object of the class
that implements it.&nbsp; This version uses a nested class and an inner
class.</li>

<li>
The "C" implementation,&nbsp; <a href="http://bingweb.binghamton.edu/~head/CS471/CODE/Scripts/bookCompany.c">bookCompany.c</a>&nbsp;
use the stdlib's qsort to sort the inventory.&nbsp; The user must supply
an ordering function to the qsort for the data being sorted.&nbsp; This
is done by implement a function for ordering following the same rules as
compare in <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.2/docs/api/java/util/Comparator.html">Comparator</a>
in Java and then passing the function as one of the parameter.</li>
</ol>
</ol>
Using the implements in 8a, 8b and 8c as models write a Haskell program
a Java and C program to keep a book inventory. <b>I prefer Java but the
two students who do not know Java have two options.&nbsp; EITHER work with
someone who does know Java (be sure to credit on hw) OR&nbsp; implement
the problem in C++ using virtual functions and NO Templetes.</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<ol TYPE=A>
<li>
Create a new data type, <b><i>Web,</i></b> that contains a<b> email address
of the author</b> and t<b>he URL </b>for a web page with additional resources
related to the book and <b>last date </b>that the URL was know to be active.&nbsp;
(In Java you can overide "toString()" to allow easy printout of the information
stored in the object".&nbsp; In Haskell you can make this type an Instance
of Show and implement show().)</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Expand the book type (given in my code) to include fields for an authors
first and last name, web information and level code.&nbsp; The level code
will be 1 for elementary school text books, 2 for middle school text books,
3 for high school text books, 4 for college text books and 5 for reference
books.&nbsp;&nbsp; The sorting order should now be based on the whether
the book has additional web based resources, then ascending order of the
level of the book,followed by ascending lexical order of author's last
name.&nbsp; You will need to update the testing data to reflect the addition
information included.&nbsp; You should make sure that there is a way to
printout all the information about the book. (Bingsuns has gcc for compiling
C.&nbsp; Spod G4, G6, G8 G22 and CR1, SLA 306,310 has Cygwin install (which
has gcc)&nbsp; Many machines on campus have Java 1.3.)</li>

<ol TYPE=A>&nbsp;</ol>
</ol>

<li>
Add<font color="#FF0000"> a f</font>unctions to my original code, <a href="http://bingweb.binghamton.edu/~head/CS471/CODE/Scripts/BookCompany.lhs">BookCompany.lhs</a>;&nbsp;<tt>
appendBooktoFile. </tt>Where&nbsp; <tt>appendBooktoFile </tt>appends a
Book (i.e. title, year and "\n") to an existing file.</li>
</ol>
</ul>

<h3>
Think about... do not turn in</h3>

<ol>
<li>
Rewrite the expression :</li>

<ol><i>map f&nbsp; </i>( <i>map g xs </i>)</ol>
using function composition and a single call to <i>map.</i>
<li>
Consider the following mystery functions:</li>

<br><i>&nbsp;mysR = foldr (flip </i>(++)) []
<br><i>&nbsp;mysL = foldl (flip </i>(++)) []
<br>&nbsp;
<ol TYPE=A>
<li>
What is the type of the mystery functions?</li>

<li>
What does these functions do?</li>

<li>
Replace (flip (++)) with just (++) what happens?</li>

<li>
Which one is more efficient and why?(See&nbsp; <a href="http://bingweb.binghamton.edu/~head/CS471/NOTES/HASKELL/4hFall00.html#TwoFolds">Why
two folds?</a> )</li>
