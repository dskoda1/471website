<b>Programming:</b>
<ol>You may find this <a href="http://cbl.leeds.ac.uk/~tamsin/prologtutorial/index.html#menu">tutorial</a>
helpful.&nbsp; The purpose of this problem 1) to make sure you are set
up to program in Prolog and 2)expose you to programming in Prolog .&nbsp;
This assignment is suppose to be very simple.&nbsp; However, if you want
to do more you can.&nbsp;&nbsp; You do not need to learn about strings
at this point.&nbsp; You can use&nbsp; <a href="http://bingweb.binghamton.edu/~head/CS471/CODE/PL/family.pl">family.pl</a>
the model for this program.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
(<b>Do not turn in this question</b>).&nbsp; Check out these built-in procedures
(Some may be helpful in the assignment):</li>

<br>see, tell, seen, told, atom, integer, bagof, setof, functor, arg, name,
help, apropos, var, trace, spy,assertz, retract, append, @>, @=&lt;. There
are two excellent sources of information, one using the help predicate
built into Prolog and the other is the <a href="http://www.swi.psy.uva.nl/projects/SWI-Prolog/">online
information</a>
<p>From the manual I copy an example:
<p>functor(?Term, ?Functor, ?Arity)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Succeeds if Term is a term with functor Functor
and arity Arity. If Term is a variable it is unified with a new term holding
only variables. functor/3 silently fails on instantiation faults (13) If
Term is an atom or number, Functor will be unified with Term and arity
will be unified with the integer 0 (zero).

Database problem: Write a database in Prolog to keep tabs of books and
magazines in a library.&nbsp; We want to represent the following type of
data in the data base:</li>

<ol TYPE=A>
<ol>"The Art Of Computer Programming" is a book in the computerSection
<br>"Communications of the ACM" is a magazine in the computerSection
<br>"Dr. Dobbs" is a magazine in the computerSection
<br>"USNews and World Report" is a magazine in the historySection
<br>"Discrete Math" is a book in the mathSection
<br>"The Torah" is a book in the religiousSection</ol>

<li>
How do you query your data base to find all the books in the computerSection?
(This is not a program, just write exactly what you need to do in the swipl
environment to display the books in the environment)</li>

</ol>

<li>
The predicate odd(n) succeeds only for odd numbers.&nbsp; Write a Prolog
program to implement it.</li>

<li>
Write a Prolog procedure makeEven(-L , +E).&nbsp; That goes through a list
of numbers and if a number is odd then its value is doubled.</li>

<ol>?- makeEven([1, 2, 4, 1], X).
<br>X = [ 2, 2, 4, 2].
<br>?- makeEven([], X).
<br>X = []</ol>

<li>
Write a procedure isIncreasing(L) that succeeds if the numbers in list
L are in non-decreasing order.</li>

<li>
Write a procedure isDecreasing(L) that succeeds if the numbers in list
L are in non-increasing order.</li>
