<body>For Friday:<br>Read <a href="http://www.learnprolognow.org/">&nbsp;Chap1 &amp; Chap3
- From "Learn Prolog Now"</a> (If Check Blackboard if link is not working.)<br><ol><li>Write a simple data base using Prolog. &nbsp;You will
create a
database of total of 8 NY and California
cities.&nbsp;&nbsp;e.g.
ny(binghamton) and ca(losAngeles). &nbsp; Include facts to indicate
large and small cities in the database e.g. small(binghamton) and
large(losAngeles). Create rule "likes" &nbsp;with the following
constraints:&nbsp; Sam likes small cities. Mary likes large cities
in
California or small cities in New York.&nbsp; Store these clauses
in a
file named <span style="font-style: italic;">cities.pl</span>.
Test your procedures.</li><li>Try problem (scott) 11.17. &nbsp;Does SWIPL interpreter behave
as described in the exercise?</li><li>What is the result of the following query.&nbsp; (Note there is a space between '=' and '-'.)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ?-&nbsp; X= -(3,4), Y is -(3,4), Z is abs(Y).</li><li>What is the difference between <span style="font-style: italic;">is</span> and = operator?</li></ol>
<br><br>
(From Monday)<br>
Note: Scott will not help you program in Prolog, however, it will help
you understand how it works. Questions from the reading may
be on pop quizzes.<br>
