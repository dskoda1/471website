<b>Written Assignment:</b></h3>

<ol>
<li>
What is the relationship between scalar types and discrete types?</li>

<li>
What are "macros" in C?&nbsp; What are they good for (i.e. What is the
"up side" of using them in your coding?) ? How are they dangerous (i.e.What
is the "down side" of using them in your coding?) ? Give examples.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
In C++, what is the difference between assigning a value to a pointer and
to a reference?</li>

<li>
Perl uses "dynamic" arrays which can increase in size during execution.&nbsp;
Explain how can the dynamic arrays can be&nbsp; implemented at runtime?</li>

<li>
An index check verifies that the index of an array is in the bounds declared
for the array. Can an index check be performed statically? Why? Why not?</li>

<li>
Given the following declaration in Ada :</li>

<ol>TYPE Array_type IS ARRAY(2..8) OF Integer;
<br>TYPE CODE is record
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Level: CHARACTER;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Salary : Integer;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Status : CHARACTER;
<br>end record;
<br>TYPE Code_Array IS ARRAY(10..15) OF CODE;
<br>arr : Array_type;
<br>codeArr : Code_Array;</ol>

<p><br>If&nbsp;&nbsp; INTEGER requires 4 bytes of storage and CHARACTER
requires 1 byte of storage what is the effective address (using bytes as
the addressable units) of <font color="#FF0000">variables below</font>
(show your calculations) You should assume that the ba (base address) for
arr is 300 and the base address for codeArr is 2100.
<ol>&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Effective address for arr(3)&nbsp; is&nbsp; __________________
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; B. Effective address for codeArr(11) is&nbsp; __________________
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; C. Effective address for codeArr(11).Status is&nbsp; __________________</ol>

<li>
Given the following declaration in Ada :</li>

<ol>TYPE Array_type IS ARRAY(1..4,10..14) OF Integer;
<br>TYPE CODE is record
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Status : CHARACTER;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Salary : Integer;
<br>end record;
<br>TYPE Code_Array IS ARRAY(1..5,10..14) OF CODE;
<br>arr : Array_type;
<br>codeArr : Code_Array;</ol>

<p><br>If&nbsp;&nbsp; INTEGER requires 4 bytes of storage and CHARACTER
requires 1 byte of storage what is the effective address (using bytes as
the addressable units) of <font color="#FF0000">variables below</font>
(show your calculations) You should assume that the ba (base address) for
arr is 260 and the base address for codeArr is 2100.
<br>&nbsp;
<ol>
<ol TYPE=A>
<li>
Using row major the effective address for arr(3,10)&nbsp; is&nbsp; __________________</li>

<li>
Using column major the effective address for arr(3,10)&nbsp; is&nbsp; __________________</li>

<li>
Using row major the effective address for codeArr(3,11) is&nbsp; __________________</li>

<li>
Using row major the effective address for codeArr(3.11).Salary is&nbsp;
