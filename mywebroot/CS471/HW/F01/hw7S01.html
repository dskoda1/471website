Purpose:
<p>Read Chapters:
<blockquote>Scott: Pages&nbsp; 320-403
<br>Any reliable sources on C, C++ and Java.&nbsp; Good online resources
<a href="http://bingweb.binghamton.edu/~head/CS471/Reference471.html">listed
(http://bingweb.binghamton.edu/~head/CS471/Reference471.html)</a> as well

<h3>
<b>Written Assignment:</b></h3>

<ol>
<li>
What are "macros" in C?&nbsp; What are they good for (i.e. What is the
"up side" of using them in your coding?) ? How are they dangerous (i.e.What
is the "down side" of using them in your coding?) ? Give examples.</li>

<li>
What does "typedef" mean in C?&nbsp; What are they good for?&nbsp; How
are they dangerous?&nbsp; Give an example where the typedef behavior is
the same in C and C++ and an example where the behavior differs .</li>

<li>
<b><i>"C</i> </b>has a single global namespace don't conveniently fit into
a single function, single struct, or single translation unit."(<i>The Design
and Evolution of C++</i>,p399)&nbsp;&nbsp; "Identifiers (in C) fall into
several name spaces that do not interfere with one another; the same identifer
may be used for different purposes, even in the same scope, if the uses
are in different name spaces.&nbsp; These classes are; objects, functions,
typedef names, and enum constants; labels; tags of structures, unions and
enumerations; and members of each structure or union individually." (K&amp;R
page 227).&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://bingweb.binghamton.edu/~head/CS471/HW/dogtest.c">C
example</a> illustrates the different name spaces.</li>

<br>What is the purpose of the "namespace" keyword in C++?&nbsp; What problem
in the C language does "namespace" solve?
<li>
In C++, what is the difference between assigning a value to a pointer and
to a reference?</li>

<li>
What is the difference between a reference type variables in C++ and reference
type variables in Java?</li>

<li>
Perl uses "dynamic" arrays which can increase in size during execution.&nbsp;
Explain how can the dynamic arrays can be&nbsp; implemented at runtime?</li>

<li>
An index check verifies that the index of an array is in the bounds declared
for the array. Can an index check be performed statically? Why? Why not?</li>

<li>
Given the following declaration in Ada :</li>

<ol>TYPE Array_type IS ARRAY(2..8) OF Integer;
<br>TYPE CODE is record
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Level: CHARACTER;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Salary : Integer;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Status : CHARACTER;
<br>end record;
<br>TYPE Code_Array IS ARRAY(10..15) OF CODE;
<br>arr : Array_type;
<br>codeArr : Code_Array;</ol>

<p><br>If&nbsp;&nbsp; INTEGER requires 4 bytes of storage and CHARACTER
requires 1 byte of storage what is the effective address (using bytes as
the addressable units) of <font color="#FF0000">variables below</font>
(show your calculations) You should assume that the ba (base address) for
arr is 300 and the base address for codeArr is 2100.
<br>&nbsp;
<ol>&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Effective address for arr(3)&nbsp; is&nbsp; __________________
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; B. Effective address for codeArr(11) is&nbsp; __________________
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; C. Effective address for codeArr(11).Status is&nbsp; __________________</ol>
