<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Scott: 209-214 (review)
</font><br>
 <br>
 Purpose: Review computer architecture and how it relates to the design of 
HOL (higher order languages) and semantics of HOL.<br>
 <br>
 
<ol>
  <br>
 <li>What is IEEE 754?</li>
  <br>
 <li>Java has 8 primitive data types.&nbsp; What are they? <font color="#006600">
How<br>
 are the different primitive types for numbers encoded</font>?&nbsp; What<br>
 is the maximum and minimum value for int,float, and double? (See <a href="http://bingweb.binghamton.edu/%7Ehead/CS471/Reference471.html#Java">
my<br>
 online Java references</a> for help.)&nbsp; The easiest way to present<br>
 you answer is in a table.<br>
  </li>
 <br>
 <li>There are 5 basic (scalar) data types in C. (Including pointers). <br>
 What are they and how are they encoded? Where do you find the maximum and<br>
 minimum values for int, float and double? In addition there are the following<br>
 qualifiers: short, long, signed and unsigned. Briefly explain effect of<br>
 the qualifiers on the basic types.&nbsp; You should mention which standard<br>
 you are using(i.e ANSI/ISO amendment I or K&amp;R&nbsp; etc.). The easiest<br>
 way to present you answer is in a table.</li>
  <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <li>How does the philosophy of C differ from Java with respect to the implementation<br>
 primitive(basic/scalar) types? (Discuss the positive and negatives of both<br>
 philosophies.).</li>
 <br>
 <li>In Java 1.3 the modifier <i><tt>strictfp</tt></i> was added.&nbsp; What<br>
 is the effect of using this modifier?&nbsp; Why was it added to the language?<br>
  </li>
 
  <ol>
 
    <ol>
 <br>
 
    </ol>
  </ol>
 <li>I have written a simple <i>C</i> program (hw6F01.c).</li>
 
  <ol type="A">
    <br>
 <li>One would expect Part 1a and Part 1b to compute and print the same value<br>
 for sum.&nbsp; One would also expect that adding ten times the value 0.1<br>
 would result in 1.0.&nbsp; (Remember <i>C</i> does not have a boolean it<br>
 uses 0 to mean false and all other values to mean true.) Compile in gcc<br>
 (either using cygwin or Sun work stations) and run.</li>
    <br>
 <br>
 <li>Does the execute as expected?</li>
    <br>
 <br>
 <li>Explain why (how) the computer gets the results for Part 1 and Part
2?</li>
    <br>
 <br>
 <li>If this code was converted to Java what would you expect to happen?</li>
 <br>
 
  </ol>
  <br>
 <li>What is a <i>homoiconic language?</i> Explain why Prolog is homoiconic. 
    <br>
 Can you name any other homoiconic language?</li>
  <br>
</ol>

<h3> Below are problems I have given for hw in previous semesters. THEY WILL<br>
 NOT BE GRADED.&nbsp; THEY ARE NOT TO BE TURNED IN.&nbsp;&nbsp; THEY ARE<br>
 SUPPLIED TO HELP YOU Prepare FOR THE PROLOG TEST</h3>
</h3>
 
<ol>
  <br>
 <li>Write a predicate isIncreasing(L) that succeeds if the numbers in list<br>
 L are in<i> non-decreasing order.</i><br>
  </li>
  <li>Using permutation in the notes and isIncreasing write the specification<br>
 of sorting in Prolog.</li>
  <br>
 <br>
 <li>The predicate odd(n) succeeds only for odd numbers.&nbsp; Write a Prolog<br>
 program to implement it.</li>
  <br>
 <br>
 <li>Write a Prolog procedure makeEven(-L , +E).&nbsp; That goes through
a list<br>
 of numbers and if a number is odd then its value is doubled.</li>
  <br>
 ?- makeEven([1, 2, 4, 1], X).<br>
 X = [ 2, 2, 4, 2].<br>
 <br>
?- makeEven( [ ], X).<br>
X = [ ]<br>
  <br>
 <li>Write a Prolog procedure sumEveryOther(-List,+Sum) that finds the sum
of<br>
 every other number in the list.</li>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
 ?- sumEveryOther([1,2,3,4], S).<br>
 &nbsp;S = 4<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
 ?- sumEveryOther([5,6,7], S).<br>
 S = 12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
 <br>
?- sumEveryOther([], S).<br>
 S = 0<br>
  <br>
  <li>Define a relation</li>
  <br>
 
  <ol type="A">
    <tt>shift(List1, List2)</tt>
  </ol>
  <br>
 so that List2 is List1 "shifted rotationally" by one element to the left.<br>
 
  <ol type="A">
    <tt>?- shift([1,2,3,4],L1), shift(L1,L2).</tt><br>
 <br>
    <tt>L1 = [2,3,4,1]</tt><br>
 <br>
    <tt>L2 = [3,4,1,2]</tt>
  </ol>
  <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (This is a one line wonder.)<br>
 <li>Write a procedure myreverse that uses a recursive algorithm to reverse<br>
 the elements of a list, thus:</li>
  <ol type="A">
    <br>
?- myreverse( [10,9,3,12], R).<br>
R = [12,3,9,10].
    <ol type="A">
 <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <li>What happens when the following query is executed?</li>
?-myreverse( R,[10,9,3,12]).<br>
      <br>
 <li>Can you briefly explain why you code works the way it does.</li>
    </ol>
  </ol>
</ol>
<blockquote>You can use the built-in relation, append, in your procedure.
However,<br>
 there are a number of different ways to program this. <br>
  <br>
  </blockquote>
  <ol start="8">
    <li>By inserting some writes and nls, get myreverse to display the arguments
of each call to itself and each call to append or any other clauses you may
use.&nbsp; <font color="#cc0000">Call your modified version, <i>myReversePrint</i>
. &nbsp;</font>What is the runtime complexity of your code as a function
of the length of the<br>
 input list <i>n</i>? Make sure your answer is consistent with the output
of <i>myReversePrint.</i></li>
  </ol>
  <ol>
    <br>
Note: write( term ) displays the term and nl gives a carriage return.<br>
