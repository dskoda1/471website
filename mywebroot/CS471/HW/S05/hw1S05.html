policy</a> <br>
There is a locked file cabinet near the cs department for you to leave
your assignment.&nbsp; Assignment is due before the TA picks it up on
Sunday.. <br>
Please submit your solutions typed up and stapled together. &nbsp;EACH
page should have your name, email, section number and page number
printed on
every page.&nbsp; Include the questions with your answers.&nbsp; (You
can edit this file)&nbsp; <a
 href="http://bingweb.binghamton.edu/%7Ehead/CS471/requirements.html">General
Submission Instructions</a> <br>
<br>
I encourage you to work in teams of 2.&nbsp; Teams should submit
<span style="font-weight: bold;">one</span> copy of homework with both
names one it. You should have the question typed in before your answer.
Answers should be concise and well
written sentences.&nbsp; Poorly written assignments will be returned to
be
reworked before grading.<br>
<h4>Purpose:&nbsp; </h4>
To examine the basic notions of programming languages, review the
history of programming languages, and understand language design
principles.

  <li>Exercise 1.1 page 30. Your code may be written&nbsp; in Java, C
or C++.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Variation of Exercise 1.5 page 30. The purpose is to examine how
"%"
(modulus/reminder) is defined in different languages.&nbsp; The mod
operator "%"
in mathematics (e.g. in
group theory) is always defined to be a positive representative of the
equivalence class..&nbsp; For example -1 % 3 would be 2. However, the
result of this
expression in many computer
languages would be -1. Different languages define/implement "%"
according to number of different rules.
Some languages provide the complete specifications of
"%" at the time language is designed.&nbsp; Other languages provide
guide
lines but let compiler writer determine the exact implementation.
&nbsp; &nbsp; </li>
  <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
    <li>What is the language specification of "%"&nbsp; in each
language,&nbsp; when is exact time&nbsp; (language design or compile
implementation) that exactly how "%" will execute in each language, and
what are the valid operand types for each language below?<br>
    </li>
    <ol>
      <li>C</li>
      <li>Java</li>
      <li>Ada&nbsp; (rem operator)<br>
      </li>
      <li>PHP</li>
      <li>Python</li>
    </ol>
    <li>What is the specification of the `mod`&nbsp; operator of
Ada?&nbsp; What is the difference between modulo operator and the
remainder operator? Can this difference lead to any differences in the
result of
the gcd (C or Java version of the greatest common divisor given in
chapter 1) computation?</li>
  </ol>
  <li>Variation
of Exercise 1.22 page 32 -- Given the following properties of a
variable, state which are static and which are dynamic, and briefly
explain <span style="font-weight: bold;">why</span> ( i.e. <span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">C</span>: a
variable is <span style="font-weight: bold;">typed</span> statically
because the compiler needs to know the type during compilation and its
can
not be changed during execution.)<br>
  </li>
  <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
    <ul>
      <li>its value</li>
      <li>its data type</li>
      <li>its name</li>
    </ul>
    <li>for C</li>
    <li>for Python <span style="font-weight: bold;">or</span> PHP<br>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <li>Exercise 2.10 page 51.&nbsp; Include the name of another
markup language.</li>
  <li>What is the difference between a scripting language and "system"
language? (See <a href="http://home.pacbell.net/ouster/scripting.html">Scripting:
Higher Level Programming for the 21st Century</a><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">)</span> <br>
  </li>
  <li>Read question 2.13 page 52.&nbsp;
What are some "useful mathematical properties" lacking in imperative
languages like Fortran, C, C++ etc?<br>
  </li>
  <li>Exercise 3.1 page 72.&nbsp; Include a definition of each the
design principles before you give you example.&nbsp; Don't forget to
specify the programming language and version you are using. <br>
  </li>
  <li>When was the latest ISO specification for 'C' approved?&nbsp;
When was the latest Ansi/ISO specification for 'C++' approved? Does
Java
have an ISO specification? Does C# have an ISO specification?<br>
  </li>
  <li>Exercise 3.15 page 74 (Specify which 'C' ANSI/ISO standard you
are using to answer the question.)<br>
