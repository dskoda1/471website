To use the make utility with my Makefile; 
  all the files for just project need to be located
in the same directory. You should make this directory the current directory 
in terminal window.

lab1_1.h  : header file for lab1_1.c 
         You should modify this file to include the prototype for
         the rewrite of powerI() using a recursive style.  The new function
         should be name powerR()
         
lab1_1.c : file containing the definition of powerI().  You should add the
          definition for powerR()
          
lab1_1EH.c : file used by the Makefile to generate assembly code.

lab1Driver.c : file containing the "main" function used to "test" functions in
           lab1_1.c.  You will need to modify to test powerR().
        
Makefile : file used by the "make" utility.
   Using make utility at the prompt type --
to execute and compile if necessary
  > make runIt

to create the assembly file in problem 2
  > make lab1p2ASM
  
lab1p2ASM32 will guarantee 32 bit assembly instructions 
  > make lab1p2ASM32
