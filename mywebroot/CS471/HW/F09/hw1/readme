To use the make utility with my Makefile; 
all the files for just project need to be located
in the same directory. You should make this directory the current directory 
in terminal window.

hw1_1.h  : header file for hw1_1.c 
         You should modify this file to include the prototype for
         the rewrite of powerI() using a recursive style.  The new function
         should be name powerR()
         
hw1_1.c : file containing the definition of powerI().  You should add the
          defintion for powerR()
hw1_1D.c : file containing the "main" function used to "test" functions in
           hw1_1.c.  You will need to modify to test powerR().
        
Makefile : file used by the "make" utility.
   Using make utitity at the prompt type --
to execute and compile if necessary
  > make runIt

to create the assembly file in problem 7
  > make hw1p7ASM
