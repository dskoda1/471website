<h4>
Assignment 5 Due Feb. 24, 2001</h4>
Purpose: Review computer architecture and how it relates to the design
of&nbsp; HOL (higher order languages).
<p>Read Chapters:
<blockquote>Scott: 209-214 (review)
<br>Any reliable source on C and Java.</blockquote>

<h3>
<b>Written Assignment:</b></h3>

<ol>
<li>
What is IEEE 754?</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Java has 8 primitive data types.&nbsp; What are they? <font color="#006600">How
are the different primitive types for numbers encoded</font>?&nbsp; What
is the maximum and minimum value for int,float, and double? (See <a href="http://bingweb.binghamton.edu/~head/CS471/Reference471.html#Java">my
online Java references</a> for help.)&nbsp; The easiest way to present
you answer is in a table.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
There are 5 basic (scalar) data types in C. (Including pointers).&nbsp;
What are they and how are they encoded? What is the maximum and minimum
values for int, float and double? In addition there are the following qualifiers:
short, long, signed and unsigned. Briefly explain effect of the qualifiers
on the basic types.&nbsp; You should mention which standard you are using(i.e
ANSI/ISO amendment I or K&amp;R&nbsp; etc.). The easiest way to present
you answer is in a table.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
How does the philosophy of C differ from Java with respect to the implementation
primitive(basic/scalar) types? (Discuss the positive and negatives of both
philosophies.).</li>

<ol>&nbsp;</ol>

<li>
Currently there is a new standard being designed for "C".&nbsp; They are
planning to have new types like <tt>long long, </tt>and<tt> long double.
</tt>What
are they (size and maximum values)?&nbsp; Why is there a necessarily to
include new types.&nbsp; Please include any pertinent links.</li>

<ol>&nbsp;</ol>

<li>
In Java 1.3 the modifier <i><tt>strictfp</tt></i> was added.&nbsp; What
is the effect of using this modifier?&nbsp; Why was it added to the language?</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
What is a <i>homoiconic language?</i> Explain why Prolog is homoiconic.&nbsp;
Can you name any other homoiconic language?</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
What is the purpose of the <i>make </i>utility used during software development
in <i>gcc</i> (see man pages)?&nbsp; What is the Makefile?</li>
</ol>

<h3>
<b>Programming Assignment:</b></h3>

<ol>
<li>
Write a predicate isIncreasing(L) that succeeds if the numbers in list
L are in</li>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; non-decreasing order.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Using permutation in the notes and isIncreasing write the specification
of sorting in Prolog.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Below are problems I have given for hw in previous semesters. THEY WILL
NOT BE GRADED.&nbsp; THEY ARE NOT TO BE TURNED IN THEY ARE SUPPLIED FOR
YOU OWN PRACTICE FOR THE PROLOG TEST.</li>

<ol TYPE=A>
<li>
The predicate odd(n) succeeds only for odd numbers.&nbsp; Write a Prolog
program to implement it.</li>

<li>
Write a Prolog procedure makeEven(-L , +E).&nbsp; That goes through a list
of numbers and if a number is odd then its value is doubled.</li>

<br>?- makeEven([1, 2, 4, 1], X).
<br>X = [ 2, 2, 4, 2].
<br>?- makeEven([], X).
<br>X = []
<li>
Write a Prolog procedure sumEveryOther(-List,+Sum) that finds the sum of
every other number in the list.</li>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
?- sumEveryOther([1,2,3,4], S).
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
S = 4
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
?- sumEveryOther([5,6,7], S).
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; S = 12
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
?- sumEveryOther([], S).
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
S = 0
<li>
Define a relation</li>

<ol TYPE=A><tt>shift(List1, List2)</tt></ol>
so that List2 is List1 "shifted rotationally" by one element to the left.
<ol TYPE=A><tt>?- shift([1,2,3,4],L1), shift(L1,L2).</tt>
<br><tt>L1 = [2,3,4,1]</tt>
<br><tt>L2 = [3,4,1,2]</tt></ol>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (This is a one line wonder.)
<li>
Write a procedure myreverse that uses a recursive algorithm to reverse
the elements of a list, thus:</li>

<ol>
<ol TYPE=a>?- myreverse( [10,9,3,12], R).
<br>R = [12,3,9,10].
<br>You can use the built-in relation, append, in your procedure. However,
there are a number of different ways to program this.&nbsp; Remember to
credit any code you lift off the internet.
<li>
What happens when the following query is executed?</li>

<br>?-myreverse( R,[10,9,3,12]).
<li>
Can you briefly explain why you code works the way it does.</li>

<br>&nbsp;</ol>
</ol>

<li>
By inserting some writes and nls, get <i>myreverse</i> to display the arguments
of each call to itself and each call to append or any other clauses you
may use.&nbsp; <font color="#CC0000">Call your modified version, <i>myReversePrint</i>.
</font>What
is the runtime complexity of your code as a function of the length of the
input list <i>n</i>? Make sure your answer is consistent with the output
of <i>myReversePrint.</i></li>

<br>Note: write( term ) displays the term and nl gives a carriage return.
See the listOf relation in <a href="http://bingweb.binghamton.edu/~head/CS471/CODE/PL/example.pl">example.pl</a>
for an example.</ol>
