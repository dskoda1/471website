  <li>Explain why does (a+b)*10 does not equal a*10 + b*10 in the
non-optimized compilation? <br />
  </li>
  <ol>
<br /><ol><li>Compile the&nbsp;code,&nbsp;<a href="numbers/p8.c">p8.c</a>,
on a&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Intel</span>
platform twice as follows:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
gcc p8.c -o labXa.exe -std=iso9899:1999 -m32</li><li>&nbsp;Run
executable:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
./labXa.exe<br />
<br />
      </li></ol>
  </ol>
  <li>The C code provided below illustrates some problems
with
the
implementation of floating point numbers. You are given&nbsp; a
simple <i>C</i>&nbsp;program
(<a href="numbers/p9.c">p9.c</a>) to run.
&nbsp;Compile and run this code using GCC. (gcc p9.c -o labXb.exe -std=iso9899:1999 -m32)
  </li>

  
  <ol>

    <li>The 4 sums are computed in part1() and printed out in.
Part
1A's printout appears to be the same independent of the
calculation order of &nbsp;the "i's". &nbsp;However, the sum
printed
out in Part 1B's printout is different. One would expect&nbsp;
program
would compute and print the same value for sum. &nbsp; Explain what
is
going on.<br />
    </li>
    <li>One would also expect that adding ten times the value 0.1
would
result in 1.0.&nbsp; Explain why (how) the computer gets the
results
for
part 2 (part2()) ?<br />
    </li>
    <li>(Harbison &amp; Steele) "Prior to ISO C, all
implementations were required to convert all values of type <b>float</b>
to type <b>double</b> before operations were performed.
&nbsp;... In ISO C, operations can now be performed using type <b>float</b>
."
&nbsp;What is the consequences of this change? ( Consider
speed,&nbsp;
accuracy, and space. )<br />
