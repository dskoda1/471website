<h3>Homework Assignment 6</h3>
</div>

<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
<ol>

</ol>

YOU NEED TO READ Chapter 3: pgs 111-121, Chapter 8: pgs 383-389, 7.7.3
pgs 357-364<br>

Due Tues (---) at end of day.&nbsp; You may work on this assignment
individually or in teams of TWO or THREE.&nbsp; Everyone must join hw6 group (1
or 2 or 3 members).<br>

<ol>

  <li>Page 163 exercise 3.1<br>
<br>
  </li>
  <li>Use <span style="font-style: italic;">gcc</span>&nbsp;
to create an assembly file of <a href="gcdR.c">gcdR.c</a>&nbsp;
(gcc -S gcdR.c -std=iso9899:1999 -o gcd1.s). &nbsp;(Note: This file
(program) can not compile and run as is because there is no <span style="font-style: italic;">main</span>.)<span style="font-style: italic;"></span> &nbsp;You can
run this remotely in harvey (see blackboard) or on campus using either
of the Linux rooms. &nbsp;</li>
  <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
    <li>Draw the activation record for gcdR(). &nbsp;
Field's offset should be consistent with the assembly code.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Which way does the program stack grow? (i.e. towards
higher addresses or lower addresses?)</li>
    <li>Annotated
the gcdR.s file. &nbsp;Indicate all the instruction that read,
write,
"create" or "delete" the stack memory. &nbsp;Name the fields
affected by
instruction.<br>
e.g<br>
31::&nbsp; movl&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $13, -4(%ebp) --
copies the value to the "<span style="font-style: italic;">n</span>"
argument field in the AR.<br>
      <br>
</li>
  </ol>
  <li>Recompile <a href="gcdR.c">gcdR.c</a> with -O2 optimization
switch (gcc -O2 -S gcdR.c -std=iso9899:1999 -o gdc2.s).</li>
  <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
    <li>Compare
the assembly file created using optimization switch with the file
created without optimization(above #2). &nbsp;Pay attention to how
gcd's
recursion is "implemented". &nbsp;How are they different?</li><br>
    <br>

  </ol>
  
  <li>The C code provided below illustrates some problems
with
the
implementation of floating point numbers. You are given&nbsp; a
simple <i>C</i>&nbsp;program
(<a href="p9.c">p9.c</a>) to run.
&nbsp;Compile and run this code using GCC. (gcc p9.c -o labXb.exe -std=iso9899:1999 -m32)
  </li>
  <ol>
<li>The 4 sums are computed in part1() and printed out in.
Part
1A's printout appears to be the same independent of the
calculation order of &nbsp;the "i's". &nbsp;However, the sum
printed
out in Part 1B's printout is different. One would expect&nbsp;
program
would compute and print the same value for sum. &nbsp; Explain what
is
going on.<br>
    </li><li>One would also expect that adding ten times the value 0.1
would
result in 1.0.&nbsp; Explain why (how) the computer gets the
results
for
part 2 (part2()) ?<br>
    </li><li>(Harbison &amp; Steele) "Prior to ISO C, all
implementations were required to convert all values of type <b>float</b>
to type <b>double</b> before operations were performed.
&nbsp;... In ISO C, operations can now be performed using type <b>float</b>
."
&nbsp;What is the consequences of this change? ( Consider
speed,&nbsp;
accuracy, and space. )<br>
      <br>
</li>
  </ol>
  <li>Many storage-management algorithms maintain a list of <span style="font-style: italic;">free blocks. &nbsp;</span>Here are two
different algorithms, <span style="font-style: italic;">first fit</span>
and <span style="font-style: italic;">best fit</span>,
used to search this list and return a block of the appropriate size.
&nbsp;Which strategy, if either, will result in lower external
fragmentation? &nbsp;What does external fragmentation depend on?<br>
    <br>
  </li>

  <li>What is the complexity of using <span style="font-style: italic;">first
fit</span>
algorithm to allocate blocks? &nbsp;Briefly explain an algorithm to
speed up
the allocation. What is the complexity of this modification?<br>
    <br>

  <li>Page 121 CYU( check your understand) #4, page 132 CYU #12
and page 164 exercise 3.4.<br>
    <br>
</li>
  <li>Page 165 exercise 3.7.<br>
    <br>
</li>
  <li>What are two principal tradeoff between reference counts and
tracing strategy used in garbage collecting?<br>
    <br>
</li>
  <li>For each of the following individuals write 2 or 3
sentences
describing
their contribution to Programming Languages/Software development or Computer Science in general.
&nbsp;Also include a
non-cs&nbsp; fact you found interesting about the person and any
links(or references) you found useful.</li>
