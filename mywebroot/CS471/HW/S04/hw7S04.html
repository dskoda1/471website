<div style="text-align: center;">Homework Assignment 7 <br>
</div>
Read: Finish chapter 5 and chapter 6<br>
Purpose: Review computer architecture and how it relates to the design
of HOL (higher order languages) and semantics of HOL. Review problems
with operators that also have side effect.&nbsp; Understand the
difference between static scoping and dynamic scoping.&nbsp; Understand
type equivalence.&nbsp; Identify some non-compatible features of C/C++.<br>
<br>
<ol>
  <li>What is specification of&nbsp; IEEE 754? &nbsp;</li>

  <li>This problem pertains to floating arithmetic and its
implementation using code in the "C" language. I have written a simple <i>C</i>
program
(<a href="http://bingweb.binghamton.edu/%7Ehead/CS471/HW/hw6S02.c"> </a>hw6F03.c
). There is a&nbsp; makefile if you want to use it. &nbsp;( <a
 href="hw7Q2.zip">hw7Q2.zip</a>
)</li>
  <ol type="A">
    <br>
    <li>Compile and run this code using GCC.(either using cygwin or Sun
work stations) <br>
      <br>
    </li>
    <li>One would expect that the Part 1A and Part 1B (part1()) of
program would&nbsp; compute and print the same value for sum.&nbsp;
(Remember <i> C</i> does not have a boolean it uses 0 to mean false
and all other values to mean true.) Does it execute as expected?<br>
      <br>
    </li>
    <li>One would also expect that adding ten times the value 0.1 would
result in 1.0.&nbsp; Explain why (how) the computer gets the results
for part
2 (part2()) ?<br>
      <br>
    </li>
    <li>(Page 133 Harbison &amp; Steele) "Prior to standard C, all
implementations were required to convert all values of type <b>float</b>
to type <b>double</b> before operations were performed. &nbsp;... In
standard C, operations can now be performed using type <b>float</b> ."
&nbsp;What is the consequences of this change? ( Consider speed,&nbsp;
accuracy, and the effect of decisions made in selection of types used
by programmer) &nbsp;<br>
    </li>
    <br>
  </ol>
  <li>Convert this code(in question 3) to Java. &nbsp;(This code can
just be implemented as static methods.) &nbsp;<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <ol type="A">
    <li>Execute this code and compare results you obtained in problem
3?&nbsp; If the results are the same--Do you always expect the results
always to be the same -- explain. If the results are different explain
why. &nbsp;<br>
      <br>
    </li>
    <li>What does the keyword <b><i>strictfp</i></b> in mean?<br>
      <br>
    </li>
    <li>Compile and run the code with the keyword <b><i>strictfp</i> .
      </b> Compare these results with the results in part 3a (Java
only). &nbsp;Explain your results.<br>
      <br>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <li>What is the difference between macros (in C)&nbsp; and functions
(in C).&nbsp;
Explain in terms of the concept of binding.</li>
  <dl>
    <dd><br>
    </dd>
  </dl>
  <li> In Ansi C the keyword <b><i>static</i></b> has two different
semantics depending on where it is used, either inside a function
definition or outside of a function definition.&nbsp; What does <b><i>static</i></b>
mean in both settings?</li>
