Homework 6: Review of computer architecture and its effect on "normally
used" programming  languages .<br>
<br>
Scott: 209-214 (review) 115-118, 129-132, 149-151, 600,637</font><br>
<br>
Purpose: Review computer architecture and how it relates to the design
of HOL (higher order languages) and semantics of HOL. &nbsp;Renforcement
of dynamic vs static scoping.<br>
<br>
<ol>
  <li>What is IEEE 754? &nbsp;</li>
  <br>
  <br>
  <li>"There are only a few basic data types in C: <i>char ... int ...
float ... double</i>" (Kernighan &amp; Ritchie p36)&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <ol type="A">
    <li>For each type: What phase (language design, implementation,
compile time, run time)&nbsp; is the decision made on how the type is
encoded<big> , i.e.<small> how much space is allocated and the format in
memory</small></big><small> ?</small> &nbsp;<br>
      <br>
    </li>
    <li>At compile time your code finds the maximum and minimum values
for char, int, float and double in the<i> /usr/include/limits.h </i>and <i>/usr/include/float.h</i>
files supplied by the implementor of the compiler (on bingsuns, gnu).
Look in these files to find these definitions (you may have to look in
files included by limits.h). Compare the values found on bingsuns to the
values provided <a
 href="http://www.acm.uiuc.edu/webmonkeys/book/c_guide/2.5.html"> here</a>.
(or K&amp;R page 257 or Harrison&amp;Steele page 124 and 127) &nbsp;
Give a reason why the values may be different. In addition there are the
following qualifiers: short, long, signed and unsigned. Briefly explain
effect of the qualifiers on the basic types. You should mention which
standard you are using(i.e ANSI/ISO amendment I or K&amp;R&nbsp; etc.).
&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <ol>
    <ol>
      <br>
    </ol>
  </ol>
  <li>The C code provided below illustrates some problems with the
implementation of floating point numbers. You are given&nbsp; a simple <i>C</i>&nbsp;program
(<a href="HW6S03Q3/hw6S03.c"> hw6S03.c</a>) to run. &nbsp;There is
a&nbsp; <a href="HW6S03Q3/makefile">makefil</a>e and<a
 href="HW6S03Q3/README"> README</a> if you want to use them. &nbsp;</li>
  <ol type="A">
    <br>
    <li>Compile and run this code using GCC.(either using cygwin or Sun
work stations) <br>
      <br>
    </li>
    <li>The 4 sums are computed in part1() and printed out in. Part
1A's printout appears to be the sam &nbsp;e independent of the
calculation order of &nbsp;the "i's". &nbsp;However, the sum printed
out in Part 1B's printout is different. One would expect&nbsp; program 
would compute and print the same value for sum. &nbsp; Explain what is
going on.<br>
      <br>
    </li>
    <li>One would also expect that adding ten times the value 0.1 would
result in 1.0.&nbsp; Explain why (how) the computer gets the results for
part 2 (part2()) ?<br>
      <br>
    </li>
    <li>(Page 117 Harbison &amp; Steele) "Prior to ISO C, all
implementations were required to convert all values of type <b>float</b>
to type <b>double</b> before operations were performed. &nbsp;... In ISO
C, operations can now be performed using type <b>float</b> ." &nbsp;What
is the consequences of this change? ( Consider speed,&nbsp; accuracy,
and the effect of decisions made in selection of types used by
programmer) &nbsp;<br>
    </li>
    <br>
  </ol>
  <li>Give an argument in favor of dynamic scoping .</li>
  <li>Page 159 exercise 3.6</li>
  <li>page 160 exercise 3.11<br>
  </li>
  <li>What is the purpose of the <i>make </i>utility used during
software development in <i>gcc</i> (see man pages)?&nbsp; What is the
Makefile?<br>
    <br>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3> Below are problems I have given for hw in previous semesters. THEY
WILL<br>
NOT BE GRADED.&nbsp; THEY ARE NOT TO BE TURNED IN.&nbsp;&nbsp; THEY ARE<br>
SUPPLIED TO HELP YOU Prepare FOR THE PROLOG TEST</h3>
<ol>
  <br>
  <li>Write a predicate isDecreasing(L) that succeeds if the numbers in
list<br>
L are in<i> non-increasing order.</i><br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Using permutation in the notes and isDecreasing to write the
specification of sorting in Prolog.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>The predicate odd(n) succeeds only for odd numbers.&nbsp; Write
a Prolog<br>
program to implement it.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Write a Prolog procedure makeEven(-L , +E).&nbsp; That goes
through a list<br>
of numbers and if a number is odd then its value is doubled.</li>
  <br>
?- makeEven([1, 2, 4, 1], X).<br>
X = [ 2, 2, 4, 2].<br>
  <br>
?- makeEven( [ ], X).<br>
X = [ ]<br>
  <br>
  <li>Write a Prolog procedure sumEveryOther(-List,+Sum) that finds the
sum of<br>
every other number in the list.</li>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
?- sumEveryOther([1,2,3,4], S).<br>
&nbsp;S = 4<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
?- sumEveryOther([5,6,7], S).<br>
S = 12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
  <br>
?- sumEveryOther([], S).<br>
S = 0<br>
  <br>
  <li>Write a procedure myreverse that uses a recursive algorithm to
reverse<br>
the elements of a list, thus:</li>
  <ol type="A">
    <br>
?- myreverse( [10,9,3,12], R).<br>
R = [12,3,9,10].
    <ol type="A">
      <br>
      <br>
      <li>What happens when the following query is executed?</li>
?-myreverse( R,[10,9,3,12]).<br>
      <br>
      <li>Can you briefly explain why you code works the way it does.</li>
    </ol>
  </ol>
</ol>
<blockquote>You can use the built-in relation, append, in your
procedure. However,<br>
there are a number of different ways to program this. <br>
  <br>
</blockquote>
<ol start="8">
  <li>By inserting some writes and nls, get myreverse to display the
arguments of each call to itself and each call to append or any other
clauses you may  use.&nbsp; <font color="#cc0000">Call your modified
version, <i> myReversePrint</i> . &nbsp;</font>What is the runtime
complexity of your code as a function  of the length of the<br>
input list <i>n</i>? Make sure your answer is consistent with the
output of <i>myReversePrint.</i></li>
</ol>
<ol>
  <br>
Note: write( term ) displays the term and nl gives a carriage return.<br>
See the listOf relation in <a
