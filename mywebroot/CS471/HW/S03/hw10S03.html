<h3>There are two parts to this assignment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>Part 1: This part may be done in groups of at most 3.&nbsp; There
is a written section and a programming section.&nbsp; If you work in a
group: You will need to include each member's name.</h3>
Purpose of this programming part is to get a sense of how to do
"generic programming" in different programming paradigms. History part
is to make sure you know some of the important contributors to Computer
Science.<br>

Programming Assignment</a> <br>
  </li>
  <li>Write a sentence or two about the following people describing
their contribution to Programming Languages. &nbsp;Also include a
non-cs&nbsp; fact you found interesting about the person and any
links(or references) you found useful.</li>

  <li>In Java instance variables have access to Class fields. &nbsp;How
could that be implemented at runtime. &nbsp;(i.e. What kind of variables
will the system create and where would it be stored. &nbsp;--- &nbsp;Try
to think about how you would modify the solutions discussed for nested
functions --Obviously you will not use the stack as part the solution .)<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Java has inner classes. &nbsp;What are inner classes? &nbsp;What
would you need to do at runtime to insure that instances of inner
classes can access outer instances fields?<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Assume the following macro in C is part of the file being
compiled:<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <dl>
    <dd># define max(A,B) ((A) &gt; (B) ? (A) : (B) )<br>
      <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; later is the following code (assume i,j, and y are
ints):<br>
      <br>
i = 3;<br>
j = 5;<br>
y = max( ++i , ++j);<br>
      <br>
What values of y, i, and j, do you expect at this point of execution of
the code? After carefully computing&nbsp; the values of y, i and j,
according the rules of <i>C,</i> what are the values?</dd>

<h3>Programming assignment (Part 2)</h3>
.&nbsp; The purpose of this programming assignment is to reinforce
polytypes and primitive recursive programming. &nbsp;<span
 style="font-weight: bold;">This is an individual effort.</span><br>
