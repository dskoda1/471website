   <li> In Ansi C the keyword <b><i>static</i></b> has two different semantics
 depending on where it is used, either inside a function definition or outside 
of a function definition.&nbsp; What does <b><i>static</i></b> mean in both 
settings?<br>

     <li>Following the definition of&nbsp; binding a name with its value, 
specify the time and stability of the binding between C++ const variable and
its value.&nbsp; What is the difference between the meaning of const in C
and C++?&nbsp; Can you come up with an example were this difference causes
code to compile in C++ and not in C?<br>
