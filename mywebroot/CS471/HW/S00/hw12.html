for presentation of&nbsp; hard copy</a></h3>

<h5>
Do not turn in. Things to think about and play with.</h5>

<ol>
<li>
Understand the terms function definition, function application, normal
order, application order,&nbsp; referential transparency , and tail recursion.
You do not need to turn this in.</li>

<li>
What does iter do? ( id, foldr and replicate are in Prelude)</li>

<br><tt>iter n f = foldr (.) id (replicate n f)</tt>
<li>
(10.5) What is the type(:t)&nbsp; and effect of the function</li>

<br><tt>\n -> iter n succ</tt>
<br><tt>?</tt>
<li>
What happens when you try to type</li>

<br><tt>iter n succ</tt>
<br><tt>?</tt>
<li>
(10.6) Given a function <i>f</i> of the type a->b->c, write down a lambda
expression that describes the function of the type b->a->c which behaves
like f but take the arguments in revise order.&nbsp; (Hint you will need
3 argurments in your lambda expression.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This will be
need for the first programming problem.</li>

<br>&nbsp;</ol>

<h3>
Written assignment:</h3>

<ol>
<li>
(Ghezzi: page 369 exercise 2:) Reduce the (<font face="Symbol">l</font>x.(x
x))(<font face="Symbol">l</font>x.(x x)).&nbsp; What is peculiar about
this expression?</li>

<li>
(From Abelson and Sussman [1985]) It is also possible to express the integer
as lambda abstractions:</li>

<br>zero =<font face="Symbol"> l </font>f&nbsp; .<font face="Symbol"> l</font>
x . x
<br>one =&nbsp;<font face="Symbol"> l</font>f.<font face="Symbol">&nbsp;
l</font> x ( f x)
<br>two =&nbsp;<font face="Symbol"> l</font> f.<font face="Symbol"> l</font>
x ( f (f x))
<br>. . . .
<p>These are called Church numbers after Alonzo Church.
<p>Given the following definition of the successor function:
<center>successor =<font face="Symbol"> l </font>n.<font face="Symbol">
l </font>f.<font face="Symbol"> l</font> x ( f (( n f ) x ) ).</center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; show that (successor zero) = one (you do not need to
turn this in)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and (successor one) = two&nbsp; (turn this in).</ol>

<h3>
<b>Programming Assignment:</b></h3>
<b>Do not post your assignment.&nbsp; Email your code to&nbsp;</b> <a href="mailto:cs471h@binghamton.edu">cs471h</a>
also following <a href="http://bingweb.binghamton.edu/~head/CS471/requirements.html">instructions</a>
for how to document your program and name your <b>attached program file.</b>
<ol>
<ol>
<li>
(10.7) Using the last exercise, or otherwise, give a definition of the
function</li>

<ol><tt>myFlip :: (a->b->c) -> (b -> a ->c)</tt></ol>
which reverses the order in which its function argument takes its arguments.&nbsp;
(We are defining the built in flip using lambda expressions).
<br><tt></tt>&nbsp;
<li>
The BookCompany program creates an inventory by adding "Book"s to the inventory.&nbsp;
The program can add "Book"s to the inventory, sort the inventory and print
out the inventory.&nbsp; It is implemented in three paradigms using Haskell,
Java and C. All three implementations use the generic sort method supplied
in their respective library.&nbsp; The sorting order of the "Book"s is
based on the ascending order of year, followed by the ascending lexical
order of the book title.</li>

<ol TYPE=A>
<ol TYPE=a>
<li>
The Haskell version, <a href="http://bingweb.binghamton.edu/~head/CS471/CODE/Scripts/BookCompany.lhs">BookCompany.lhs&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;
is implemented literal style. It uses the sort definition found in <a href="http://haskell.org/onlinelibrary/list.html">List.hs</a>
. In order to use the sort the type Book must be in the class Ord.&nbsp;
Therefore the user must declare Book to be in class Ord as well as implement
the expected methods.</li>

<li>
The Java implementation, <a href="http://bingweb.binghamton.edu/~head/CS471/CODE/Scripts/BookCompany.java">BookCompany.java,</a>
uses the static method&nbsp; <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.2/docs/api/java/util/Collections.html#sort(java.util.List, java.util.Comparator)">sort</a>
found in the <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.2/docs/api/java/util/Collections.html">java.util.Collections</a>
class .&nbsp; Sort uses a modified mergesort to sort a list of mutually
comparable elements.&nbsp; The user must supply an ordering of "Book" to
the sorting method.&nbsp; This is done by implementing the interface <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.2/docs/api/java/util/Comparator.html">Comparator</a>&nbsp;
for the elements type in the list and passing the an object of the class
that implements it.&nbsp; This version uses a nested class and an inner
class.</li>

<li>
The "C" implementation,&nbsp; <a href="http://bingweb.binghamton.edu/~head/CS471/CODE/Scripts/bookCompany.c">bookCompany.c</a>&nbsp;
use the stdlib's qsort to sort the inventory.&nbsp; The user must supply
an ordering function to the qsort for the data being sorted.&nbsp; This
is done by implement a function for ordering following the same rules as
compare in <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.2/docs/api/java/util/Comparator.html">Comparator</a>
in Java and then passing the function as one of the parameter.</li>
</ol>

<li>
Using the implements in 8a, 8b and 8c as models write a Haskell program
a Java and C program to keep a book inventory. Java may be coded in groups.
Expand the book type (in above) to include fields for an authors first
and last name.&nbsp; The sorting order should now be based descending order
of year, followed by ascending lexical order of author's last name and
finally the the ascending lexical order of book title.&nbsp; You will need
to update the testing data&nbsp; to reflect the addition information included.&nbsp;
You should make sure that there is a way to printout all the information
about the book. (Bingsuns has gcc for compiling C.&nbsp; Many machines
on campus have Java 1.2.)&nbsp; ONLY JAVA CAN BE DONE AS A GROUP.</li>
