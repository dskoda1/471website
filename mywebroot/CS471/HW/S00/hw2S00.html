<p><br><b>Part 1: Written assignment:</b>
<br><b>Purpose:</b>
<li>
<b>To reenforce ideas presented in chapter 1 of text not covered in class.</b></li>

<li>
<b>To review/learn about "C"</b></li>

<li>
<b>To review how syntax rules work.</b></li>

<ol>
<li>
What is <i>aliasing</i>?&nbsp; Take one or two languages you have had experience
discuss the below.</li>

<ol TYPE=a>
<li>
What kind of aliasing is allowed in the language?&nbsp; What is the syntax
and semantics of the expression?</li>

<li>
How does it effect <i>readability</i>, <i>writability and reliability?</i></li>

<br>&nbsp;</ol>

<li>
page 32 exercise 3. -- Write a program&nbsp; that shows why the optimization
mentioned in Section 1.5.3 can not be done in general for C (or C++ or
Java. Choose which ever you are most comfitable with.&nbsp; NOTE: Later
there will be C programming required).Briefly explain why your code is
an example.&nbsp; You must make sure your code compiles.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
In a language of your choice:</li>

<ol TYPE=a>
<li>
Give an example/feature (other than the one in the notes) where the design
of the language illustrates the application of <b><i>the principle of orthogonality.</i></b></li>

<li>
Does this feature promote <i>readability?</i> <i>writability?</i></li>

<li>
Give an example/feature where the design is not <b><i>orthogonal</i></b>
.</li>

<li>
Does this feature promote <i>readability?</i> <i>writability?</i></li>
</ol>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
In class we studied the <a href="http://bingweb.binghamton.edu/~head/CS471/NOTES/4Spr00.html#DanglingElse">"dangling-else"
problem</a>.</li>

<ol TYPE=a>
<li>
How does "C" solve this problem?</li>

<li>
You are a language designer and need to specify an "if-else-statement".&nbsp;
We need to make sure the compiler know which "if" the "else" binds to.&nbsp;
The notes provide one solution, "C" provides another.&nbsp;&nbsp; You are
to provide a third. You may use&nbsp; solutions provided in other programming
languages or your invent your solution.</li>
</ol>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
What is the idea behind<i> open source software? </i>Where on the web can
one find information about open source software?&nbsp; Name an open source
program.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
page 107 problem 2 Modify syntax rules in Figure 2.1 page 35</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Consider the following grammar:</li>

<ol TYPE=a>&lt;assign> ::= &lt;id> := &lt;expr>
<br>&lt;id> ::= A | B | C
<br>&lt;expr> ::= &lt;expr> * &lt;term>
<ol>
<ol>| &lt;term></ol>
</ol>
&lt;term> ::= &lt;term> + &lt;factor>
<ol>
<ol>| &lt;factor></ol>
</ol>
&lt;factor> ::=&nbsp; <b>(</b> &lt;expr> <b>)</b>
<ol>
<ol><b>| &lt;</b>id></ol>
</ol>

<li>
Show a leftmost derivation for each of the following statements:</li>

<ol TYPE=a>
<li>
A :=&nbsp; A * (B + C)</li>

<li>
A := B + C * A</li>
</ol>

<li>
Draw the parse tree for:&nbsp; (You may draw tree by hand).</li>

<ol TYPE=a>
<li>
A := B + C * A</li>
</ol>
</ol>
</ol>

<p><b>Part 2 Programming:</b>
<blockquote>You may find this <a href="http://cbl.leeds.ac.uk/~tamsin/prologtutorial/index.html#menu">tutorial</a>
helpful.&nbsp; The purpose of this problem 1) to make sure you are set
up to program in Prolog and 2)expose you to programming in Prolog .&nbsp;
This assignment is suppose to be very simple.&nbsp; However, if you want
to do more you can.&nbsp;&nbsp; You do not need to learn about strings
at this point.&nbsp; You can use&nbsp; <a href="http://bingweb.binghamton.edu/~head/CS471/CODE/PL/family.pl">family.pl</a>
the model for this program.
<ol>
<li>
Database problem: Write a database in Prolog to keep tabs of books and
magazines in a library.&nbsp; We want to represent the following type of
data in the data base:</li>

<ol>"The Art Of Computer Programming" is a book in the computerSection
<br>"Communications of the ACM" is a magazine in the computerSection
<br>"Dr. Dobbs" is a magazine in the computerSection
<br>"USNews and World Report" is a magazine in the historySection
<br>"Discrete Math" is a book in the mathSection
<br>"The Torah" is a book in the religiousSection</ol>

<li>
How do you query your data base to find all the books in the computerSection?
(This is not a program, just write exactly what you need to do in the swipl
environment to display the books in the environment)</li>
