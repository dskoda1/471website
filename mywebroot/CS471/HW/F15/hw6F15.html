<h3>Homework Assignment 6</h3>
</div>

<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
<ol>

</ol>

YOU NEED TO READ Chapter 3: pgs 111-121,&nbsp; <br>

Due Tues at end of day.&nbsp; You may work on this assignment
individually or in teams of up to THREE members.<br>
<br>
Either a txt or pdf file for format, MUST be tar'd (no single
submission like the .pl assignment). I will announce this to them
before the test starts this week.<br>
<br>
They must list all group members they worked with at the top of the
file in their header.&nbsp; INSTRUCTIONS ARE #6 at this

  <li>Page 163 exercise 3.1<br>
<br>
  </li>
  <li>Use <span style="font-style: italic;">gcc</span>&nbsp;
to create an assembly file of <a href="powerR.c">powerR.c</a>&nbsp;
(gcc -S gcdR.c -std=iso9899:1999 -o gcd1.s). &nbsp;(Note: This file
(program) can not compile and run as is because there is no <span style="font-style: italic;">main</span>.)<span style="font-style: italic;"></span> &nbsp;You can
run this remotely on the department machines by <br>
ssh remote.cs.binghamton.edu -l&lt;your id&gt;<br>
</li>
  <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
    <li>Draw the activation record for powerR(). &nbsp;
Field's offset should be consistent with the assembly code.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Which way does the program stack grow? (i.e. towards
higher addresses or lower addresses?)</li>
    <li>Annotated
the powerR.s file. &nbsp;Indicate all the instruction that read,
write,
"create" or "delete" the stack memory. &nbsp;Name the fields
affected by
instruction.&nbsp; <br>
e.g<br>
31::&nbsp; movl&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $13, -4(%ebp) --
copies the value to the "<span style="font-style: italic;">n</span>"
argument field in the AR.<br>
      <br>
</li>
  </ol>
  <li>Recompile&nbsp;<a href="powerR.c" >powerR.c</a> with -O2 optimization
switch (gcc -O2 -S gcdR.c -std=iso9899:1999 -o gdc2.s).</li>
  <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
    <li>Compare
the assembly file created using optimization switch with the file
created without optimization(above #2). &nbsp;Pay attention to how powers's
recursion is "implemented". &nbsp;How are they different?<br>
      <br>
</li>
  </ol>
  <li>Many storage-management algorithms maintain a list of <span style="font-style: italic;">free blocks. &nbsp;</span>Here are two
different algorithms, <span style="font-style: italic;">first fit</span>
and <span style="font-style: italic;">best fit</span>,
used to search this list and return a block of the appropriate size.
&nbsp;Which strategy, if either, will result in lower external
fragmentation? &nbsp;What does external fragmentation depend on?<br>
    <br>
</li>
  <li>What is the complexity of using <span style="font-style: italic;">first
fit</span>
algorithm to allocate blocks? &nbsp;Briefly explain an algorithm to
speed up
the allocation. What is the complexity of this modification?<br>
