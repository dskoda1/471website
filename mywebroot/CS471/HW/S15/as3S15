    Define a predicate convertToDecimal(Succ, Decimal), which converts the
    succ representation for numbers to decimal representation.
i.e.
  ?- convertToDecimal(succ(succ(succ(succ(succ(0))))),N).
  N = 5.
  ?- convertToDecimal(S,4).
  S = succ(succ(succ(succ(0)))) .

/*2: Define a predicate minus(Succ1, Succ2, MinusSucc), which subtracts Succ2 
     in succ notations from Succ1  in succ notations
     and the result is in succ notation.  
     
     DO NOT convert succ notation to decimal.  You may assume
     only succ notation is used by the query.
     ie.
      ?- minus(succ(succ(succ(succ(succ(0))))), succ(succ(0)), Diff).
      Diff = succ(succ(succ(0))).
      ?- minus(succ(succ(succ(0))), OP, succ(succ(0)) ).

/* 3: Using solution from problem 2 define add(Succ1, Succ2, Diff).

/* 7: Define the "prefix" predicate so that "prefix(X,Y)" says that 
      X is a list that is a prefix of Y.  That is, each element of X 
      unifies with the corresponding element of Y, but Y may contain 
      additional elements after that.  Check that your predicate works 
      when X is uninstantiated: given a query like "prefix(X,[1,2,3]), it 
      should find all the prefixes of the list [1,2,3] (after each result
      use ";" instead of return).
      e.g.
       ?- prefix(X,[a,b,c]).
       X = [] ;
       X = [a] ;
       X = [a, b] ;
