Fall 2002 CS471 Homework #3 Written Assignment Solution 
Question 1:  Describe how the list structure is implement in prolog? 
(i.e. What is the runtime environment?). 
You can use drawings and data structures to help your explain. You should be 
able to do this in two or three sentences. 
(See class notes for diagrams).


Answer :  Prolog provides direct implementation of linked list data structures 
through its built-in head/tail list notation (i.e., [_|_]).  
Therefore lists are dynamically (during runtime)typed and sized, 
and lists can be heterogeneous (made of up mixed type).  
In addition, the head and tail portions are how the elements in a list 
are accessed. 
This means there is really no other direct and effecient way of 
accessing all the elements of a list other than by cycling through 
the list recursively hence making use of 
its [Head|Tail] notation to access each element through the head.

Question 2: Show how the following lists are bound after unification in your in your implementation. 
Answer: 
a. A = [1,2] 
b. H = 1, T = [2,3] 
c. H1 = 1, H2 = 2, T = [3] 
d. H = [1,2,3], T = [a, [c,d]]
