  Homework 6: Review of computer architecture and its effect on "normally
used" programming  languages .<br>
  <br>
  Scott: 209-214 (review) </font><br>
    <br>
    Purpose: Review computer architecture and how it relates to the design
 of  HOL (higher order languages) and semantics of HOL.<br>
    <br>
 
<ol>
    <li>What is IEEE 754? &nbsp;</li>
     <br>
      <br>
    <li>"There are only a few basic data types in C: <i>char ... int ...
float  ... double</i>" (Kernighan &amp; Ritchie p36)&nbsp;<br>
     <br>
   </li>
                     
  <ol type="A">
     <li>For each type: What phase (language design, implementation, compile
time, run time)&nbsp; is the decision made on how the type is encoded<big>
 , i.e.<small> how much space is allocated and the format in memory</small></big><small>
 ?</small> &nbsp;<br>
       <br>
     </li>
     <li>At compile time your code finds the maximum and minimum values for
char, int, float and double in the<i> /usr/include/limits.h </i>and <i>/usr/include/float.h</i>
  files supplied by the implementor of the compiler (on bingsuns, gnu). Look
in these files to find these definitions (you may have to look in files included
by limits.h). Compare the values found on bingsuns to the values provided
      <a href="http://www.acm.uiuc.edu/webmonkeys/book/c_guide/2.5.html">
 here</a>. (or K&amp;R page 257 or Harrison&amp;Steele page 112 and 118)
&nbsp; Give a reason why the values may be different. In addition there are
the following qualifiers: short, long, signed and unsigned. Briefly explain
effect of the qualifiers on the basic types. You should mention which standard
you are using(i.e ANSI/ISO amendment I or K&amp;R&nbsp; etc.). &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
       <br>
     </li>
     <li>The 99 standard has&nbsp; new types like long long, and long double.
&nbsp;      What are they (size and maximum values)?&nbsp; Why is there a
necessarily to include new types?&nbsp; Please include any pertinent links.
     <br>
     </li>
                     
  </ol>
                               
  <ol>
                                                 
    <ol>
    <br>
                                                 
    </ol>
                             
  </ol>
    <li>The C code provided below illustrates some problems with the implementation
of floating point numbers. You are given&nbsp; a simple <i>C</i>&nbsp;program
(<a href="HW6F02Q3/hw6F02.c">  hw6F02.c</a>) to run. &nbsp;There is a&nbsp;
    <a href="HW6F02Q3/makefile">makefil</a>e and<a
 href="HW6F02Q3/README"> README</a> if you want to use them. &nbsp;(&nbsp;<a
 href="HW6F02Q3/Hw6f02.zip">Hw6f02.zip</a> )</li>
                               
  <ol type="A">
       <br>
    <li>Compile and run this code using GCC.(either using cygwin or Sun work
stations) <br>
       <br>
     </li>
    <li>The 4 sums are computed in part1() and printed out in. Part 1A's printout
appears to be the same independent of the calculation order of &nbsp;the "i's".
&nbsp;However, the sum printed out in Part 1B's printout is different. One
would expect&nbsp; program  would compute and print the same value for sum.
&nbsp; Explain what is going on.<br>
       <br>
     </li>
          <li>One would also expect that adding ten times the value 0.1 would
result in 1.0.&nbsp; Explain why (how) the computer gets the results for part
2 (part2()) ?<br>
       <br>
     </li>
     <li>(Page 117 Harbison &amp; Steele) "Prior to ISO C, all implementations
were required to convert all values of type <b>float</b> to type <b>double</b>
  before operations were performed. &nbsp;... In ISO C, operations can now
be performed using type <b>float</b> ." &nbsp;What is the consequences of
this change? ( Consider speed,&nbsp; accuracy, and the effect of decisions
made in selection of types used by programmer) &nbsp;<br>
     </li>
       <br>
                            
  </ol>
    <li>Convert this code(in question 3) to Java. &nbsp;(This code can just
 be static methods.) &nbsp;<br>
     <br>
   </li>
                         
  <ol type="A">
           <li>Execute this code and compare results you obtained in problem
3?&nbsp; If the results are the same--Do you always expect the results always
to be the same -- explain. If the results are different explain why. &nbsp;<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>What does the keyword <b><i>strictfp</i></b> in mean?<br>
       <br>
     </li>
     <li>Compile and run the code with the keyword <b><i>strictfp</i> . </b>
  Compare these results with the results in part 4a (Java only). &nbsp;Explain
 your results.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
                         
  </ol>
     <li> What is the purpose of the <i>make </i>utility used during software
 development in <i>gcc</i> (see man pages)?&nbsp; What is the Makefile?<br>
      <br>
    </li>
    <li>What is a <i>homoiconic language?</i> Explain why Prolog is homoiconic.
      <br>
    Can you name any other homoiconic language?</li>
     <br>

<h3> Below are problems I have given for hw in previous semesters. THEY WILL<br>
    NOT BE GRADED.&nbsp; THEY ARE NOT TO BE TURNED IN.&nbsp;&nbsp; THEY ARE<br>
    SUPPLIED TO HELP YOU Prepare FOR THE PROLOG TEST</h3>
        
<ol>
     <br>
    <li>Write a predicate isDecreasing(L) that succeeds if the numbers in

 However,<br>
    there are a number of different ways to program this. <br>

       <li>By inserting some writes and nls, get myreverse to display the
arguments  of each call to itself and each call to append or any other clauses
you may  use.&nbsp; <font color="#cc0000">Call your modified version, <i>
 myReversePrint</i>  . &nbsp;</font>What is the runtime complexity of your
code as a function  of the length of the<br>
