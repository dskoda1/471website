The make command should work on linux, Suns and cygwin.

To use the makefile:

1) To execute the program without the debugger:

    make runIt

"make" will read the target "runIt" and try to find it in the Makefile.

"runIt" needs the file "hw6F02".  It the file exists then make will just execute it.
If "hw6F02" does not exists then it will look for a target "hw6F02" and follow 
the targets instructions on how to build it.


2) To execute the program within the debugger:

	make  runDB

    To execute on Sun or Linux platform

	make runSunDB


3) To compile the program and produce an assembly file of it: 
	
	make  hw6ASM

4) To compile and just make an executable:

	make  hw6F02

(If you use emacs or a variant of emacs --
<meta> x compile <return>

then fill in the Target name. )
