<p><br>Written assignment:
<ol>
<li>
What is <i>aliasing</i>?&nbsp; Take one or two languages you have had experience
discuss the below.</li>

<ol TYPE=a>
<li>
What kind of aliasing is allowed in the language?&nbsp; What is the syntax
and semantics of the expression?</li>

<li>
How does it effect <i>readability</i>, <i>writabilty and reliability?</i></li>
</ol>

<li>
page 32 exercise 3. (Your program may be in C,&nbsp; Java or C++)</li>

<li>
In a language of your choice:</li>

<ol TYPE=a>
<li>
Give an example/feature where the design of the language illustrates the
application of <b><i>the principle of orthogonality.</i></b></li>

<li>
Does this feature promote <i>readability?</i> <i>writability?</i></li>

<li>
Give an example/feature where the design is not <b><i>orthogonal</i></b>
.</li>

<li>
Does this feature promote <i>readability?</i> <i>writability?</i></li>
</ol>

<li>
page 107 problem 2</li>

<li>
Consider the following grammar:</li>

<ol>&lt;assign> ::= &lt;id> := &lt;expr>
<br>&lt;id> ::= A | B | C
<br>&lt;expr> ::= &lt;expr> + &lt;expr>
<ol>
<ol>| &lt;expr> * &lt;expr>
<br><b>| (</b> &lt;expr> <b>)</b>
<br><b>| &lt;</b>id></ol>
</ol>
</ol>
Show this grammar is ambiguous by giving an example of string accepted
by this grammar that has at least two different parse trees.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Consider the following grammar:</li>

<ol>&lt;assign> ::= &lt;id> := &lt;expr>
<br>&lt;id> ::= A | B | C
<br>&lt;expr> ::= &lt;expr> * &lt;term>
<ol>
<ol>| &lt;term></ol>
</ol>
&lt;term> ::= &lt;term> + &lt;factor>
<ol>
<ol>| &lt;factor></ol>
</ol>
&lt;factor> ::=&nbsp; <b>(</b> &lt;expr> <b>)</b>
<ol>
<ol><b>| &lt;</b>id></ol>
</ol>
</ol>
Show a leftmost derivation for each of the following statements:
<ol TYPE=a>
<li>
A := ( C + B ) * A</li>

<li>
A := B + C + A</li>
</ol>
</ol>
