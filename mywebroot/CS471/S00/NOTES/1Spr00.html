<h3>
What is a <i>programming language?</i></h3>

<ul>
<li>
A <b><i>programming language</i></b> is a notational system for describing
computation in a machine-readable and human-readable form. (Louden)</li>

<ul>
<li>
<i>computation: </i>any process that can be carried out by a computer</li>

<li>
<i>machine-readable</i>: the language structure (syntax) is simple enough
to allow for efficient translation into machine code</li>

<li>
<i>human-readable:</i> provide easy to understand abstractions of actions</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<h3>
History of Programming Languages</h3>

<ul>
<li>
1944, Von Neumann described a <i>stored</i> <i>program computer</i></li>

<ul>
<li>
Each program for the first computers had to be hard wired by hand.</li>

<li>
Later switches were put on a console</li>
</ul>

<li>
The original view of a program was to <b>control a computer</b></li>

<br>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<li>
1951, Wilkes, Wheeler and Gill published a book that described an <i>assembler.</i></li>

<ul>
<li>
Introduced the idea of subroutines</li>

<li>
Subroutines were written in machine code</li>

<ul>
<ul>00001011
<br>10100101
<br>...</ul>
</ul>
</ul>

<li>
Mid 1950, assembly language introduced mnemonics to represent machine instructions
with a <i>program</i> to translate it into machine code.</li>

<ul>
<ul>
<ul><tt></tt>&nbsp;
<br><tt>LDA&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; STOR1</tt>
<br><tt>ADD&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; STOR2</tt>
<br><tt>STA&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; STOR3</tt>
<br><tt>JNZ&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LOC17</tt>
<br><tt></tt>&nbsp;</ul>
</ul>

<li>
Assemblers are programs that convert assembly programs to machine code.</li>
</ul>

<p><br>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<li>
1954-57, John Backus developed FORmula TRANslation the first widely accepted
compiled language.</li>

<ul>
<ul>
<ul>&nbsp;
<br>SUM = 0.0
<br>SUM = SUM + ARR(I)
<br>IF (SUM .GT. 20.5) STOP
<br>&nbsp;</ul>
</ul>

<li>
Fortran is first high-level language</li>

<li>
A <i>high-level </i>language is simply a programming language whose instruction
format is</li>

<ul>
<li>
more closely related to the problem domain of the problem than to the instructions
of the computer that will run the program.</li>
</ul>

<li>
Fortran influenced Algol 60 and its decendents, PL/I, BASIC</li>
</ul>

<p><br>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<li>
Mid 50s, interest devoloped in solving non-numerical problems.</li>

<li>
1956, Allen Newell, J.C. Shaw and Herbert Simon published a paper that
described the first AI program and a language that could implement it.</li>

<ul>
<li>
It was too low level to be widely accepted.<br>
</li>
</ul>

<li>
1956-62, J. McCarthy developed <b>LIS</b>t <b>P</b>rocessing the first
highly successful symbol processing language for AI</li>

<ul>
<ul>
<ul>&nbsp;
<br>(DEFUN SUM_LIST(L)
<br>(+(CAR L)(SUM_LIST(CDR L)))
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;</ul>
</ul>

<li>
First accepted language not based on controlling a machine but based on
the (mathematic) computational model, <b><i>Lambda Calculus.<br>
</i></b></li>

<li>
Recursion in functions is the key programming technique<br>
</li>

<li>
In addition to introducing recursion, Lisp introduced:</li>

<ul>
<li>
garbage collection</li>

<li>
conditional expressions</li>

<ul>
<li>
Algol's conditional expression was suggested by McCarthy who was a member
of the Algol committee.</li>
</ul>

<li>
interactive program execution<br>
</li>
</ul>

<li>
ML (Milner 1978), Miranda(1986) and <b><font color="#3333FF">Haskell</font></b>
(1988) are pure functional languages that are influenced by Lisp.</li>
</ul>

<p><br>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<li>
1958-60, Committee developed ALGOL 60 to provide a general, expressive
language for describing algorthms.</li>

<ul>
<li>
The most important milestone in developing modern languages.</li>

<ul>
<li>
Algol 60 led to Algol 68 which led directly to <font color="#990000">C</font>
and then <font color="#990000">C++</font>.</li>

<li>
Algol 60 led to Algol W which led to Pascal and Ada</li>

<li>
Algol 60 led to Simula and then Simula 67 and then Smalltalk<br>
</li>
</ul>

<li>
Many reason Algol 60 was not widely accepted language</li>

<ul>
<li>
Too flexible which made it hard to difficult to understand and to implement
efficiently.<br>
</li>
</ul>

<li>
Introduced:</li>

<ul>
<li>
block structions</li>

<li>
recursive function calls to procedural languages</li>

<li>
first language whose syntax was formally described (using BNF)</li>

<ul>
<li>
Backus was a principle member of the design team</li>

<li>
Interesting in the 60s BNF seemed too complicated and was one of the reason
Algol 60 was not accepted.</li>
</ul>

<li>
Affected the design a some Burroughs machine to include stack which enable
an efficient implementation of block structures and recursive procedures.</li>

<br>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></ul>
</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
1963-68, Committee developed Algol 68 was designed to be a general purpose
language as opposed to having the scientific orientation of Algol 60.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>
Design goal was to make the various features of the language as <i>orthogonal
</i>as
possible.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<b><i>Orthogonality</i>&nbsp; </b>means that:</li>

<ul>language features can be used in any combination,
<br>the combinations all make sense
<br>meaning of a given feature is consistent.</ul>

<li>
Did not distinguish between <i>expressions and statements</i></li>
</ul>
<i></i>
<li>
Introduced:</li>

<ul>
<li>
User-defined data types</li>

<li>
dynamic arrays</li>
</ul>

<li>
The use of an unknown metalanguage to describe the language was one of
the reason the language was not accepted and the difficulty of implementing
the language.</li>
</ul>

<p><br>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<li>
1965-67 Nygaard &amp; Dahl created Simula 67 the first object oriented
language</li>

<ul>
<li>
It was invented for writing simulation programs</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Programs in Simula is a model of some process in the real world as opposed
to a set of actions that we want a computer to carry out.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Introduced "classes"</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Smalltalk80 and Eiffel follows from Simula67.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<font color="#990000">Java</font>’s semantics follows from Smalltalk but
the syntax follows from C.</li>
</ul>

<p><br>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
1974-1983, international committee created Ada which was to be "one" for
use by the Dept. Of Defense (DoD).</li>

<ul>
<li>
In 1974, the US Government studied the languages in use by the Department
of Defense (DoD):</li>

<br>there were more than 450 in use in the DoD alone!
<ul>
<li>
several thousand programming languages have been developed</li>
</ul>

<li>
The lead designer of Ada (Jean Ichbiah) claims that only Ada can be used
safely for programs over 1,000,000 lines of code</li>

<li>
Any large piece of software (at least 100,000 lines of code) WILL have
errors</li>

<li>
Ichbiah’s claim is that programs of that size in C or C++ are simply unfixable</li>

<li>
A sophisticated word processor could be around 300,000 lines</li>

<li>
The new air-traffic control system is supposed to be getting close 10 million
lines of code</li>

<br>&nbsp;</ul>

<hr WIDTH="100%">
<li>
Early 70s, Alain and Colmerauer, Phillippe Roussel (France) and Robert
Kowalski (Edinburgh) developed the fundamental design of Prolog.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<b><font color="#000099">Prolog</font></b> is logic-programming languages
(called fifth-generation languages in the 80’s)</li>

<li>
Programs consist of a data base and rules that are queried.</li>

<li>
ISO standard became available late in 1995.</li>

<br>&nbsp;</ul>

<hr WIDTH="100%">
<li>
There are many applications-generator languages</li>

<ul>
<li>
they started with COBOL-generators in the 70’s and 80’s.</li>

<li>
now we have Visual Basic, Javascript, etc.</li>
</ul>

<li>
There are scripting languages (immediately executable)</li>

<ul>
<li>
REXX, OREXX, PERL, Tcl/Tk</li>
</ul>

<li>
There are macro-languages, especially for spreadsheets, e.g. for Lotus,
Excel, Quattro</li>

<li>
There are languages to display documents, HTML</li>
</ul>
